/**
 * @title Interest-bearing ERC20-like token for Lido Liquid Stacking protocol.
 *
 * This contract is abstract. To make the contract deployable override the
 * `_getTotalPooledEther` function. `Lido.sol` contract inherits StETH and defines
 * the `_getTotalPooledEther` function.
 *
 * StETH balances are dynamic and represent the holder's share in the total amount
 * of Ether controlled by the protocol. Account shares aren't normalized, so the
 * contract also stores the sum of all shares to calculate each account's token balance
 * which equals to:
 *
 *   shares[account] * _getTotalPooledEther() / _getTotalShares()
 *
 * For example, assume that we have:
 *
 *   _getTotalPooledEther() -> 10 ETH
 *   sharesOf(user1) -> 100
 *   sharesOf(user2) -> 400
 *
 * Therefore:
 *
 *   balanceOf(user1) -> 2 tokens which corresponds 2 ETH
 *   balanceOf(user2) -> 8 tokens which corresponds 8 ETH
 *
 * Since balances of all token holders change when the amount of total pooled Ether
 * changes, this token cannot fully implement ERC20 standard: it only emits `Transfer`
 * events upon explicit transfer between holders. In contrast, when total amount of
 * pooled Ether increases, no `Transfer` events are generated: doing so would require
 * emitting an event for each token holder and thus running an unbounded loop.
 *
 * The token inherits from `Pausable` and uses `whenNotStopped` modifier for methods
 * which change `shares` or `allowances`. `_stop` and `_resume` functions are overriden
 * in `Lido.sol` and might be called by an account with the `PAUSE_ROLE` assigned by the
 * DAO. This is useful for emergency scenarios, e.g. a protocol bug, where one might want
 * to freeze all token transfers and approvals until the emergency is resolved.
